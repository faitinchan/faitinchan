# Ho Tin (Timothy) Chan
Fueled by a strong passion for mathematics, physics, and computer science, I actively create educational content on my YouTube channel Maths Pupil, focusing on solutions and rigorous proofs of advanced pure mathematics problems. I also maintain an evolving portfolio on GitHub, where I showcase programming projects that highlight my problem-solving abilities, coding proficiency, and commitment to continuous learning. My goal is to apply analytical thinking and technical skills to solve meaningful problems in both academic and real-world settings.
## Current Focus
- Harvard CS50's Introduction to Computer Science
- Backend Developer (roadmap.sh)
- Maths Pupil YouTube Channel
## My Repositories
- [JavaScript Practice Projects](https://github.com/faitinchan/JavaScript_Practice)
- [Harvard CS50's Introduction to Computer Science (2025)](https://github.com/faitinchan/CS50x)
- [My Arch Linux Configuration](https://github.com/faitinchan/My_Arch_Linux_Configuration)
