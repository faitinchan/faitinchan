# Ho Tin (Timothy) Chan
A wandering mage of arcane knowledge and artisan craft who walks a path beyond the ordinary. Master of the unseen laws of physics, the hidden patterns of pure mathematics, and the secrets of computing, I blend these mysteries with the tangible art of woodwork and handcrafted technology. Born from a journey through scientific research, engineering, and teaching, I now weave philosophy, craftsmanship, and innovation into a tapestry of creation.

In the workshop of fine wood veneer, I hone my skills to balance tradition and the future. Through a growing community on my channel, I share explorations of mathematics, physics, embedded systems, and the eternal quest for understanding. Guided by insatiable curiosity and a spirit forged by self-invention, I craft not only objects but a legend where arcana and artifice converge.
