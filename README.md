# Ho Tin (Timothy) Chan
Aspiring network and cybersecurity engineer exploring protocols, infrastructure, and systems security. Currently transitioning from a multidisciplinary background in biotech research, HVAC estimation, and STEM education.

Iâ€™m actively learning through hands-on labs, self-study, and projects focused on networking and cybersecurity. I'm also beginning to explore low-level systems programming in C, with future plans to build a physics engine inspired by differential geometry concepts.

This GitHub showcases my progress, experiments, and small wins as I grow in the field.
